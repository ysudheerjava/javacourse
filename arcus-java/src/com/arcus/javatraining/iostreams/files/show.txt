5 classes

1. File
2. FileWriter
3. FileReader
4. BufferedWriter
5. BufferedReader



Different constructors of File class:

1. File f = new File(String name); //used to create a file and directory
createNewFile(); and mkdir();

2. File f = new File(String subdirectoryname, String name);
3. File f = new File(File subdir, String name);


FileWriter class
We can write character data to the file. 

constructor 1:
--------------
FileWriter f = new FileWriter(String name);

Example:
FileWriter f = new FileWriter("myfile.txt");

constructor 2: 
--------------
FileWriter f = new FileWriter(File f);

Example:

File f = new File("myfile.txt")
FileWriter f = new FileWriter(f);

constructor 3: 
--------------

FileWriter f = new FileWriter(String name, boolean append);

India is my country. All Indians are my brothers and sisters 

constructor 4: 
--------------
FileWriter f = new FileWriter(File f, boolean append);


write(char ch)  -- used to write a single character

write (char[])

write(String s)

flush(); //guarantees that all the characters have been written to the file. 

close();  // closes the stream


FileReader class:
================
Read the existing files

FileReader fr=new FileReader(String name);

FileReader fr=new FileReader (File f);

int read(); //reads next character from the file.

int read(char[] ch)

close();

BufferedWriter and BufferedReader classes: 
==========================================

Buffering concept: 

Output will be moved to a special memory location called buffer. 

BufferedWriter class:

Advatange of BufferedWriter is it reads the data line by line. 

Constructors:
===============
BufferedWriter bw=new BufferedWriter(writer w);
BufferedWriter bw=new BufferedWriter(writer w,int buffersize);


BufferedReader:
===============

Constructors
------------
BufferedREader bw=new BufferedReader(Reader r);
BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(Reader r,int buffersize);


PrintWriter:
============

PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(String s) //accepts name of the file as a string

PrintWriter pw=new PrintWriter(File f); //accepts a file as argument

PrintWriter pw=new PrintWriter(Writer w);// accepts a Writer as argument

1. write(int ch);
2. write (char[] ch);
3. write(String s);
4. flush();
5. close();
6. print(char ch);
7. print (int i);
8. print (double d);
9. print (boolean b);
10. print (String s);
11. println(char ch);
12. println (int i);
13. println(double d);
14. println(boolean b);
15. println(String s);



Serialization:
--------------

The process of converting an object into a byte stream is called Serialization.
The byteStream can be saved to a file or can be sent over a netwrok or can be sent to another computer or socket.

Deserialization: 
----------------
- The reverse process of converting a byte stream to an object. 

Steps to implement serialization: 
---------------------------------

1. Your object class should implement serializable interface
2. adding  import java.io.Serializable
3. FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(file path);
4. ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fileout);
5. out.writeObject(objectname);
6. out.close(); fileout.close.
