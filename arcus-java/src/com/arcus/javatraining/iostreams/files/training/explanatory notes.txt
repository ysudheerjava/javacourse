Different classes to handle files:

File
FileWriter
FileReader
BufferedWriter
BufferedReader
PrintWriter

File class methods: 
-------------------

exists();
createNewFile();
mkdir();
isFile();
isDirectory();

FileWriter class - Used to write character data to file

FileWriter f = new FileWriter(String fileName);
FileWriter f = new FileWriter(File f);

FileWriter methods: 
Methods present in FileWriter;
=================================
1. write(int ch) - write single character

fw.write(100);//d
or fw.write('d');

2. write(char[] ch)

3. write(String s)
4. flush(): makes sure that the data is emptied from the stream, to guarantee that total data including the last character is also written
5. close() after writing the file : closes the file


FileReader class:
====================

Constructors:
-------------

FileReader f = new FileReader(String fileName);
FileReader f = new FileReader(File f);

Methods:
1. int read();
It attempts to read next character from the file and return its Unicode value. If
the next character is not available then we will get -1.
2. int i=fr.read();
3. System.out.println((char)i);
As this method returns unicode value , while printing we have to perform type
casting.
4. int read(char[] ch);
It attempts to read enough characters from the file into char[] array and returns
the no of characters copied from the file into char[] array.
5. File f=new File("abc.txt");
6. Char[] ch=new Char[(int)f.length()];
7. void close();

- The main problem with FileWriter is we have to insert line separator manually ,
  which is difficult to the programmer. ('\n')
- And even line separator varing from system to system.



PrintWriter:
============
-  This is the most enhanced Writer to write text data to the file.
-  By using FileWriter and BufferedWriter we can write only character data to the
	File but by using PrintWriter we can write any type of data to the File.

Constructors:

PrintWriter pw = new  PrintWriter(String name);

Serialization:
=============

Process of converting an object into a byte Stream.

Deserialization:

Reverse process of serialization, converting the byte stream to an object.  

Marker Interface: Interface without any methods. 

1. We can perform Serialization only for Serilizable objects.
2. An object is said to be Serilizable if and only if the corresponding class
implements Serializable interface.
