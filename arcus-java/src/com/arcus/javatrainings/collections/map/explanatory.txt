
Map
====
-  The map interface is present in java.util package
-  represents a mapping between a key and a value. 
-  The Map interface is not a subtype of the Collection interface. 
-  Therefore it behaves a bit differently from the rest of the collection types. - A map contains unique keys.
-  Maps are perfect to use for key-value association mapping 

- A Map cannot contain duplicate keys and 
- Both keys and values are objects
- Each key value pair is called Entry.
- Some implementations allow null key and null values like the HashMap and LinkedHashMap, 
    but some do not allow null like the TreeMap.
- The order of a map depends on the specific implementations.
 For example, TreeMap and LinkedHashMap have predictable orders, while HashMap does not.
- 
- There are two interfaces for implementing Map in java. 
- They are Map and SortedMap, 
- and three classes: HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap.


Entry Interface 
---------------

Entry - I


interface Map {

	interface Entry {
	Object getKey()
	Object getValue()
	Object setValue(Object new)
}

Key Points about HashMap
-------
- The underlying data Structure is Hashtable.
- Duplicate Keys are not Allowed. But Values can be Duplicated.
- Heterogeneous Objects are allowed for Both Keys and Values.
- Insertion Order is not preserved and it is based on hash code of the keys. 
- insertion order is based on hash code of keys
- null Insertion is allowed for Key (Only Once) 
- for Values (Any Number of Times)
- implements serializable and cloneable
- Preferable for search operations

Methods in HashMap:
------------------
1.put(Object key, Object value)
2. void putAll(Map m)  
3. boolean containsKey(key)
4. boolean containsValue(value)
5. boolean isEmpty()
6. int size();
7. clear()
8. Set keySet() // in keys dups not allowed
9. Collection values() // there can be dups in values
10. Set entrySet()


LinkedHashMap class:
---------------

1. Subclass or child of class  HashMap
2. Underlying data structure is a combination of hashtable and linkedlist
3. Insertion order is preserved


SortedMap Interface
====================

1. It is the Child Interface of Map.
2. Key value Pairs are sorted according to some sorting order. 
3. When the key value pairs are to be in a sorted order, 
   it is preferable choice to choose SortedMap classes.
   
 Methods in SortedMap interface:
 --------------------------------
1) Object firstKey();
2) Object lastKey();
3) SortedMap headMap(Object key)
4) SortedMap tailMap(Object key)
5) SortedMap subMap(Object key1, Object key2)


TreeMap class:
--------------
1. Duplicate keys are not allowed.
2. Insertion Order is not preserved as it is base on Some Sorting Order of Keys.
3. If we are depending on Default Natural Sorting Order then the Keys should be Homogeneous
   and Comparable.
4. Otherwise we will get Runtime Exception Saying ClassCastException.
5. If we defining Our Own Sorting by Comparator then Keys can be Heterogeneous and Non -
Comparable. 


Constructors:
--------------
1. TreeMap tree = new TreeMap(); //default sorting order.
2. TreeMap tree = new TreeMap(Comparator c);
3. TreeMap t = new  TreeMap(SortedMap m);
4. TreeMap t = New TreeMap(Map m);
