 HashSet:
=========

- The Underlying Data Structure is Hashtable.
- The HashSet is a class that implements the Set interface. 
- It is used to store the objects in a hashtable; 
- a hashtable is a data structure, which stores data in an ArrayList. 
- It provides quick access to the data using the array index. 
- We can insert, update, and remove the elements easily using a HashSet.
- Insertion Order is not Preserved and it is Based on hashCode of the Objects.
- Duplicate Objects are Not Allowed. 
- If we are trying to Insert Duplicate Objects then we won't get any 
  Compile Time OR Runtime Error. add() Simply Returns false.
- one null Insertion is Possible.
- Heterogeneous objects are allowed.
- HashSet implements Serializable and Cloneable Interfaces
- If Our Frequent Operation is Search Operation, then HashSet is the Best Choice.
- Creates an Empty HashSet Object with Default Initial Capacity 16 and 
- Default Fill Ratio : 0.75.
- Load Factor: Fill Ratio 0.75 Means After Filling 75% Automatically a New HashSet Object will be Created.
  This Factor is Called Fill Ratio OR Load Factor.
  
  -  HashSet h = new HashSet(int initialCapacity, float fillRatio);
  -  HashSet h = new HashSet(Collection c);



LinkedHashSet:

- It is the Child Class of HashSet.
- It is Exactly Same as HashSet except the following differences:

- based on LinkedList and HashTable
-Insertion order is preserved

How to chose beteween Hashset and LinkedHashSet
-----------------------------------------------
- when maintaining the insertion order of the elements is not our priority, the HashSet will be useful and 
provide improved performance.



SortedSet interface:
-------------------

- Child interface of Set
- No duplicates are allowed
- Elements are inserted with some sorting order 
-Default sorting order - for numerics -ascending order, for alphabets in alphabetical order
 
 Methods in Sorted Set: 
 ----------------------
 
 1) Object first(); Returns 1st Element of the SortedSet.
2) Object last(); Returns Last Element of the SortedSet.
3) SortedSet headSet(Object obj);
Returns SortedSet whose Elements are < Object.
4) SortedSet tailSet(Object obj);
Returns SortedSet whose Elements are >= Object.
5) SortedSet subSet(Object obj1, Object obj2);
Returns SortedSet whose Elements are >= obj1 and < obj2.
6) Comparator comparator();
  Returns Comparator Object that Describes Underlying Sorting Technique.
- If we are using Default Natural Sorting Order then we will get null.

TreeSet class
=============

- Insertion Order is not Preserved and it is Based on Some Sorting Order.
- Heterogeneous Objects are Not Allowed.
- If we are trying to Insert we will get RuntimeException Saying ClassCastException.
- Duplicate Objects are Not allowed.

obj1.compareTo(obj2)
-  Returns –ve if and Only if obj1 has to Come Before obj2
-  Returns +ve if and Only if obj1 has to Come After obj2
-  Returns 0 if and Only if obj1 and obj2 are Equal
